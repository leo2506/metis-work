# Good or Bad Loans?

## Overview
The project is intended to build a classification model to detect risky clients and enhance policies against losses for Lending Club, a peer-to-peer loan company. The dataset is acquired from `Kaggle.com`[https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data], which records loan data from 2007 to 2015. The model predicts whether an applicant is going to keep paying on time.
